Running
      make clean
      make
in the root directory generates
      ./getTwissWithShell/getTwissWithShell,
and
      ./getMapWithOpticsCalculator/getMapWithOpticsCalculator,
both executables.

Running
      ./getTwissWithShell/getTwissWithShell
in the root directory generates
      working.twiss
there. It is based on
      ./working.sxf

Running
      ./getMapWithOpticsCalculator/getMapWithOpticsCalculator
in the root directory generates
      working.map1
there. It is based on
      ./working.sxf

These can be archived/renamed as the user deems fit. Some care about not losing them in the clean is warranted.
