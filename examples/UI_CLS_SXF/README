$ perl -d UI_CLS_SXF-256.pl   # to step through perl script enter "n" (for next step)
                                               # after that "n" or CR

CLS.pl     - Perl script 
./data/CLS.sxf 
./out/  - directory with output files 

Comments concerning UAL
------------
1.  All energies are measured in GEV
2.  This includes electric field units being GeV/m
3. "mass" is always mc^2, always in GeV units
3.  "energy" is always "total energy"
4.  i.e. E = mc^2 + K
5. gamma = E/mc^2 > 1 for m>0.
