There's a new tar, qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz. It is a small modification to qt-x11-free-3.3.4.tar, the free qt code from Trolltech ca 2005.

It's likely downloaded from GIT
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual1

This larger repository, $UAL, must be built first. The equivalent of
      cd ual1
      setenv UAL `pwd`
needs to be run.

Everything keys off this environmental variable: $UAL.

There's a new tcshrc (without the leading dot) whose environmental variables should be "sourced". It's probably easiest to overwrite ~/.tcshrc with it, then launch a new terminal. It must be edited first so that this new terminal comes up in the downloaded ual1.

The current tcshrc would give
      UALUSR = ~ (login directory)
      UAL = ~/UAL_GUI/ual1

Then, from unpack of qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz:
      tar xvfz qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz
      cd       qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod

      and commands
            ./configure --thread -no-xft -qt-gif --no-exceptions
                  yes
      can be run. This is the "legacy" procedure, dating back 15 years or so. It may or may not be "current". The "yes" is for the token license acceptance for the qt3 use. Otherwise, it would probably be better to upload the unpacked tar.

Then
      make clean
      make all >&! make.log
finishes the original, and slightly augmented, qt-x11-free-3.3.4 build. Note that this "breaks" the conventional UAL build process.

Then
      pushd examples/Player
      cp XXXMakefileXXX Makefile
      make clean
      make all 
completes the mod build.

Finally
      ./Player
completes the "smoke test" if an USPAS template GUI appears.

This has verified on SL7.6 (Nitrogen).
