This README file is from repository, $UAL/, likely already downloaded from GIT:
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual1

This repository must be built first. The equivalent of
      cd ual1
      setenv UAL `pwd`
      source setup-linux-ual
      make clean
      make >&! make.log
needs to be run and verified (no errors in make.log, other than the two doc/html ones).
Everything keys off environmental variable: $UAL.
This is all assumed as quickly familiar, and under control.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Thus this README really starts here, and really only applies to the gui subdirectory, $UAL/gui/.

There's a fairly explicit RECIPE section after this section.

This gui build/make recipe/subprocess is not nearly as seamless as the larger repository build!
Thus it should be followed carefully. Possibly it will be improved at some point.

The gui run verification is simple at this point. it is planned to be improved.

There's two tars in $UAL/gui/:
      (i)  qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz
                 This is a small modification to qt-x11-free-3.3.4.tar, the free qt code from Trolltech ca 2005.
                 I use "our legacy" configuration procedure, dating back 15 years or so.
                 This may or may not be "current".
                 There is a token license acceptance for the qt3 use.

      (ii) root_v4.04.02.source-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz
                 This is a fairly small modification to root_v4.04.02.source.tar, the free root code from CERN ca 2000.
                       The main mods are:
                             <iostream.h> -->> <iostream>
                             cerr         -->> std::cerr
                             cout         -->> std::cout
                             endl         -->> std::endl
                       in 100 files or so.
                       A few lines/stanzas are simply commented out.
                 I use "our legacy" configuration procedure, dating back 20 years or so.
                 This may or may not be "current".
These tars would probably work more seamlessly unpacked. Possibly this will be done at some point.

The recipe below has been verified on a Lenovo X201 laptop with SL7.6 (Nitrogen) ca 5/12/2020.
This partially accounts for the awkward names.

RECIPE:

      cd $UAL/gui                                                     <<<<<<------

(1) spot check the muParser build:
      cd muparser_v134
      ./configure
      make
      cd ..

(2) spot check the root build:
      tar xvfz root_v4.04.02.source-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz
      cd       root_v4.04.02.source-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod
      ./configure --enable-shared --enable-thread --enable-soversion --enable-qt --enable-table --disable-ldap
      make >&! make.log
      cd ..

(3) spot check the qt build:
      tar xvfz qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod.tar.gz
      cd       qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod
      ./configure --thread -no-xft -qt-gif --no-exceptions
            yes                                                       <<<<<<------
      make all >&! make.log
Note the license acceptance, and unfamiliar, make all, syntax!        <<<<<<------
      cd ..

(4) spot check the UAL ROOT build:
      cd ROOT
      make >&! make.log
      cd ..

(5) spot check the UAL QT build:
      cd QT
      make >&! make.log
      cd ..

(6) spot check the UAL QT example build:
      cd qt-x11-free-3.3.4-SL7.6Nitrogen-UAL-mod/examples/Player
      cp XXXMakefileXXX Makefile
      make clean
      make all                                                        <<<<<<------
Note the modified, make all, syntax!                                  <<<<<<------

(7) spot check the UAL QT example run:
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ../../lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      ./Player
A template GUI should popup.
An error message
      ...cannot open shared object file...
might appear. The above LD_LIBRARY_PATH mod is one such patch. It is not necessary on the verified box.
