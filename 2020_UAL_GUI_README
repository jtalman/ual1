There's a new tar, qt-x11-free-3.3.4-mod.tar. It is a small modification to qt-x11-free-3.3.4.tar, the free qt code from Trolltech ca 2005.

It's likely downloaded from GIT
      git clone git://github.com/jtalman/ual1

This larger repository, $UAL, must be built first. The equivalent of
      cd ual1
      setenv UAL `pwd`
needs to be run.

Everything keys off this environmental variable: $UAL.

There's a new tcshrc (without the leading dot) whose environmental variables should be "sourced". It's probably easiest to overwrite ~/.tcshrc with it, then launch a new terminal. It must be edited first so that this new terminal comes up in the downloaded ual1.

The current tcshrc would give
      UALUSR = ~ (login directory)
      UAL = ~/UAL_GUI/ual1

Then, from unpack of qt-x11-free-3.3.4-mod.tar:
      tar xvf qt-x11-free-3.3.4-mod.tar
      cd qt-x11-free-3.3.4

      Then command
            ./configure --thread -no-xft -qt-gif --no-exceptions
                  yes
      can be run. This is the "legacy" procedure, dating back 15 years or so. It may or may not be "current".

Then
      make clean
      make all >&! make.log
finishes the original qt-x11-free-3.3.4 build. Note that this "breaks" the conventional UAL build process.

Then
      pushd examples/Player
      cp XXXMakefileXXX Makefile
      make clean
      make all 
completes the mod build.

Finally
      ./Player
completes the "smoke test" if an USPAS template GUI appears.

This has verified on SL5.2 (Boron).
